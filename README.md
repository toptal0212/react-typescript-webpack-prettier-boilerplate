# React-Typescript-Webpack-Prettier Starter Kit (Production Ready 🚀)

The aim of this project is to create a custom React+Typescript starter code template powered by Webpack, Prettier and ESLint including development as well as production ready template.

## Motivation 💪

Every single day we're getting the newer and better versions of the day-to-day tools/packages that we use and with the upgraded versions, some methods/functions are being deprecated or completely removed.
I faced the same issue while I started working on the newest versions of Webpack and other plugins and I spent hours and hours to solve all the issues. 

And ultimately it worked all fine :). So I thought why not make a boilerplate setup so that no-one gets lost like me again.
